# Security Policy

Thank you for your interest in keeping Helixque safe. This document explains how to report security vulnerabilities and what to expect after you report one.

## Supported Versions

We actively maintain the `main` branch. For released versions, we support the latest published release and the previous minor release. If you believe a vulnerability affects an unsupported version, please still report it â€” we'll advise on mitigation.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please report it privately to the maintainers so we can investigate and remediate before public disclosure.

Preferred contact:

- Email: security@helixque.com (If this inbox is unavailable, open an issue and mark it `security` and we will follow up privately.)

If email is not an option, you may open a GitHub issue and request a private discussion by including the word `security` in the title. Do NOT include exploit code or sensitive details in a public issue.

## What to include

When reporting, please include:

- A short, clear description of the issue
- Versions and environment where the issue was observed
- Step-by-step reproduction instructions or a PoC (encrypted if sensitive)
- Any suggested mitigation or steps we should take to reproduce

## Optional: Encrypted Reports

If you prefer to send sensitive information (for example, exploit code or credentials), encrypt it with the maintainer's PGP key. If a PGP key is not available, contact us by email and we will provide a secure method for sharing details.

## Response Policy

- Acknowledgement: We will acknowledge receipt within 5 business days.
- Triage & Fix: We aim to triage critical reports within 7 business days and provide a remediation timeline or workaround. Complex issues may take longer; we will provide updates.
- Coordinated Disclosure: We appreciate coordinated disclosure. We will not publicly disclose the issue until a fix or mitigation is available, unless required by law.
- Credit: If you would like credit for the report, state your preferred name or handle. We will honor requests to remain anonymous.

## Security Fixes and Releases

We will prioritize fixes based on severity. For fixes that affect released versions, we will publish patches or releases and document the CVE or advisory if applicable.

## Legal

We will not pursue legal action against good-faith security researchers following this policy. Avoid non-consensual testing of user data, account takeover, or denial-of-service testing unless you have explicit permission.
